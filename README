Nginx push module - redirect a request body to other waiting requests

If you want a long-polling server but don't want to wait on idle connections
via upstream proxies, use this module to have nginx accept client connections.
Communication with clients is done via a different location, one only accessible
to your application.

Example conf:

	#message source server
	server {
        listen       localhost:8089; 
        location / {
			default_type  text/plain;
            set $push_id $arg_id; #/?id=239aff3 or somesuch
			push_source;
        }
    }

	#long-polling client server
	server {
        listen       8088;
        location / {
			default_type  text/plain;
            set $push_id $arg_id; #/?id=239aff3 or somesuch
			push_destination;
        }
    }	
	
Clients will connect to http://example.com:8088/?id=... and have the 
response delayed until a message is POSTed to http://localhost:8089/?id=...
Messages can be sent to clients that have not yet connected, i.e. they are queued.

Upon sending a request to a push_source location, the server will respond with 
a 201 Created if the message has been sent. If it must be queued up (i.e. the 
destination id is presently connected), a 202 Accepted will be sent.

It's a damn good idea to make sure the push_source location is not visible
publically, as it is intended for use only by your application.
