Nchan - Turn NGiNX into an adept HTTP pub/sub server.
It supports Websockets, long-polling, and interval-polling.
  
After a near-complete rewrite, Nginx HTTP Push Module is now Nchan. For the old pushmodule, see the 'legacy' branch.

THIS CODE IS NOT YET READY FOR RELEASE. BUILDER BEWARE.

Readme and other documentation will be rewritten for the next
release... which is coming very soon...
